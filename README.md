## DUE: by Thursday, May 6

## Introduction

Designed for use with [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/) and
[GatorGrader](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader/), this repository
contains the starter files for a class activity ten. The GitHub Actions CI is not used in this repository.

This assignment invites a developer to explore exceptions.

## Running Commands

Assuming that you have [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv), [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv), and its dependencies correctly installed, you can run the following command to execute the program:

- `pipenv run python3 termfrequency/compute_tf.py inputs/input.txt`

To run this command, you must be in the main directory for this
assignment where the configuration files are located. Then, you can type these
commands in the terminal and study the output.
